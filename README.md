# Pyber_analysis

## Overview

Pyber, a Python based ride_sharing app company asked to create a new DataFrame of the ride-sahring data by city type: 'Urban', 'Suburban' and 'Rural'. The company needs to know the following information that need to be summarized in a Python DataFrame_

* Total Rides
* Total Drivers
* Total Fares
* Average Fare per Ride
* Average Fare per Driver

With this information it will be presented a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

In the following lines it will be presented the analysis made on the data set that Pyber handed in in which we created the below DataFrame.

* The highlights of the DataFrame are:


1. There are 13x more rides in the urban cities than in the rural, also the number of Drivers is considerably larger in the Urban city type than in the other two.

2. The urban cities  earned almost 10x more money in Fares then the rural cities and almost 2x more than the suburban cities.

3. The most expensive Fare per Ride the Rural city type, being almost 40% more expensive than an Urban one.

4. The total drivers in the urban cities is larger that the number of rides done, that is why the average Fare per Driver is so low even when the number of rides and Fares are greater than the other two types.

It was also performed an analysis in how was the Total Fare by City Type changing during the 1st quarter of 2019.

* This graph shows how little the total Fare changed during the 1st quarter of 2019, there are some positive spikes but also negative that might at the end balance the Total Fare earned during this period of time

## Summary

After analysing the data here are presented our business recommendations addressing the disparites between city types:

* Elevate the Fares for Rural and Suburban city types. This is a recommendation to lower the gap of Total Fares earned between this two city types. It is clear that are lower users considering the Total Ride figures, therefore, it should be a change in strategy to keep this clients by giving them the excellent Pyber service but incrementing the Fare for each ride.

* In the urban cities for some reason there are more drivers using the Pyber than people actually using the app for a Ride. To get a more consistent Average Fare per Driver the company should focus on lowering the drivers registered in the app or targetting new clients into the Pyber riding app to at least have more rides than drivers.

* The total Fare by city shows that Pyber has a steady client bottomline, we can target new clients by advertising the app and looking into different fields of commuting like offering services to other companies, schools or larger groups that need transportation.
